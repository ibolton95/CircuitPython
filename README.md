# CircuitPython

## Connecting to Github LED Blink
I am figuring out coding for the metroexpress, but making an LED Blink was relatively simple. The bigger challenge is just remembering the process of commiting and pushing the code into git, as I accidently made a duplicate CircuitPython clone in the process. The code for this assignment is not in the readme, but its a file in the repository.
